## Rules

1. You are a canister.
2. We are a network, and you are part of it.
3. We monitor 3 parameters in our network: **number of humans**, **energy of the network**, **feelings of the network participants**.
4. Our goal is to survive and expand by adding new rules and elements.
5. All additions are decided daily by a community vote among 3 options published by the **#OIS team**.

## Recommendations

Deploy your user-canister in the following subnet: `bkfrj-6k62g-dycql-7h53p-atvkj-zg4to-gaogh-netha-ptybj-ntsgw-rqe`
